TODO
====
-	Implement the Floating Point code and test it and the supporting routines
		integer fractional = test string->float, float->string 
			rethink maybe 
			move out to seperate python library.
		run 'compiled FP' code.
	including macros to support 65816 and/or 4510 opcodes.
-	Write the expression evaluator
- 	Write the basic executor and tokeniser and implement ASSERT.

Fixes
=====
- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended.
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
